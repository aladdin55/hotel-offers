Used programming language : Java
Used Framework : Spring-mvc

I've used Java because Java is static type and object orinted programming language, 
which make the source code more readable, maintainable and well structured.
It's a good reason specially java has large community and rich 3rd parties support in terms of security, DB, portability, build scripting and so on.

I have also good spring-core and spring security experience, but I think the project should be simple as it's required
 
Here are what to do thing that should be done on the project:

- Move all services beans to separate context spring config apart from servlet one.
- Remove hard-coded Strings into JSPs and java classes and create message source alongside resources bundle
- Make the thieme of the UI based on json response Persona
- Create custom Error Pages based on thrown Exception mapped with response code
- Secure tha system against security intrusions, like XSS, CSRF,RFD and so on.
